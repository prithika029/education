# Education

This project addresses inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools.Using data science methods, this project analyzes 
average student performance on the ACT or SAT exams that students take as part of the college application process. Visualizations and statistical tests are used to support the findings and provide insights into range of school performance on these exams and the school performance associated with socioeconomic factors.
